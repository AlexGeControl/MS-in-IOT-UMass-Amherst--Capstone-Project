# TF-Openpose Environment 

This Docker solution provides a running environment for tf-openpose with nvidia runtime

---

## Dependencies

Please make sure you have installed Docker CE and enabled NVIDIA runtime on your device.

## Build

```shell
docker build -t intelli-train:frontend -f frontend.Dockerfile .
docker build -t intelli-train:backend -f backend.Dockerfile .
```

## Launch

The instance will need one camera device to collect input video. It also provides a built-in VNC server for easy debugging:

- **Camera Input**: The instance will fetch video from **/dev/video0**
- **Remote Desktop**: The VNC server is running on port **5901**

Map your host device ID and port accordingly, then launch the instance using the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 --device /dev/[HOST_VIDEO_DEVICE_ID]:/dev/video0 -p 5901:5901 -v $PWD/workspace:/workspace --name=frontend intelli-train:frontend
```

Then you can use any VNC client to acess the remote desktop for debugging at host device port 5901
